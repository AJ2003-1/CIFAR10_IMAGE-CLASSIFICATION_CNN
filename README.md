# CIFAR10_IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION_CNN
This project applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained to recognize 10 object categories using deep learning concepts such as convolution, pooling, and dense layers. Evaluation metrics and accuracy results are included.
